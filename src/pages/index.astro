      <p>
        Trying to learn new things and improve my skills in front-end
        development. Learning through online courses and my own projects. I'm
        also getting some experience in school or freelance projects with the
        help of my friend who's much more experienced in the craft. The main
        focus is on React and TypeScript. My biggest motivation is to create
        something useful and interesting.

      <p>
        I'm always trying to automate things around me. I'm using Python and
        JavaScript for this purpose. I'm also trying to learn new things and
        improve my skills in this area. Once I even made my own server with an
        old PC wreck for my Discord bot. My biggest project in this area was a
        final project for my school. It was a virtual assistant that helped me
        to organize not just my school life.

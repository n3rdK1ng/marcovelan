        I am a highly motivated software enthusiast with a passion for front-end
        development and automating tasks. With years of experience in learning
        how to code and building personal projects, I am always eager to learn
        new skills and take on new challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
         My focus is currently on React and TypeScript, and I have gained
        experience through both freelance and school projects.
        <br />
        <br />
         In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in Czech and English,
        and have some proficiency in Spanish and Croatian.

        <b>Self-taught</b>, Ostrava, Czech Republic – (2022 - present)
      </p>
      <p>
        As a self-taught frontend developer, I am passionate about building
        beautiful and functional websites and applications. I am constantly
        seeking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends
        and technologies. To do so, I am pursuing online courses and personal
        projects, while also gaining hands-on experience through school and
        freelance projects.
        <br />
        <br />
         Collaborating with a more experienced friend, I have worked on projects
        using React and TypeScript, where I have honed my skills in building
        responsive, user-friendly interfaces. My ultimate goal is to create
        impactful, innovative products that serve a purpose and delight users.

        <b>Hobby</b>, Czech Republic – (2018 - present)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking for ways to automate and optimize the world around
        me, using Python and JavaScript to create more efficient systems. In
        fact, I once salvaged an old and damaged PC to build my own server,
        which allowed me to run a Discord bot for my community. While it was
        more of a fun project than a critical tool, it was rewarding to see how
        I challenged myself and achieved a personal milestone.
        <br />
        <br />
         Another highlight of my automation work was a final project for school,
        where I built a virtual assistant to help me organize various aspects of
        my life. Through this project and others, I am constantly pushing myself
        to learn and improve my skills.
